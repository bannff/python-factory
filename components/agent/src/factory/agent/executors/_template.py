"""Single ``{{var}}`` template substitution helper.

Shared by ``executors/swarm.py`` and ``executors/graph.py`` to inject
context variables into agent system prompts. Mirrors the regex shape
of ``registry/launch_validator._resolve_template`` — the validator
uses the same pattern for templated skill refs and was deliberately
kept in sync (Wave 1 launch validator note).

Missing variables are left as-is; callers surface them via the
launch validator's ``Missing required context variable`` path.
