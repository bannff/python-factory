"""Curated tool selection for the Companion X chat agent.

Defines WHICH MCP tools the chat agent gets access to.
The HOW (in-process callables vs MCPClient HTTP) is the adapter's job.

Tool prefixes map to bricks. We select a useful subset — not all 300+.
Selection is intentionally **stable** — does not depend on user query.
The chat agent is cached per ``thread_id`` to keep conversation history;
rebuilding it with a different tool set on every turn would either lose
memory (cache miss) or leave it with stale tools (cache hit).
