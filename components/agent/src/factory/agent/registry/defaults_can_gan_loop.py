"""Closed-loop adversarial CAN synthesis agent (Epic 6 — Agentic Dataset Skills).

Extracted from ``defaults_can_agents`` to keep that file under the
200 LOC repo guardrail. The can-gan-loop agent runs an iterative
adversarial synthesis loop — LightGBM, LSTM, and TCN are trained
each iteration and the orchestrator tracks which architecture
benefits most from improved synthetic data. The agent is portable
to external drive (no S3 coupling) and stores iteration state in
memory tagged ``can-gan-loop``.

Re-imported into ``defaults_can_agents.CAN_AGENTS`` so the public
``CAN_AGENTS`` list contract is unchanged. Workflow detail lives
in ``skills/can-gan-loop/SKILL.md`` and is loaded via the
AgentSkills plugin (progressive disclosure).
