"""CAN bus failure prediction agent personas (Epic 6 — Agentic Dataset Skills).

Four specialist agents that compose the Relativix CAN pipeline:

  can-ingest       — MF4 parser + DBC matcher (uses can-analyst)
  can-profiler     — signal boundary / temporal correlation (uses can-analyst)
  can-synthesizer  — synthetic CAN data + failure injection; also
                     orchestrates the recipe-driven can-window and
                     can-augment data stages via the recipe
                     materializer (uses can-recipe-author)
  can-trainer      — time-series training + evaluation (uses can-evaluator)

The agent graph (see ``defaults_can_pipeline``) reflects a 5-stage
data pipeline (ingest → profile → synthesize → window → augment) plus
the post-pipeline ML train step. Window and augment are recipe-driven
data transformations — they have no agent persona of their own; the
graph nodes for them share ``can-synthesizer`` because the recipe
materializer executes all five dataset stages in a single
``recipe://local/can-pipeline-aug@1`` submission.

All four agents reference ``compx-platform`` for the shared brick API
catalog (inserted FIRST per strands-expert verdict ``a4843cb1`` Q4 —
the SDK iterates skills in insertion order).

Workflow detail lives in the respective skills/<name>/SKILL.md and is
loaded via the AgentSkills plugin (progressive disclosure). Prompts
are intentionally thin (<1500 chars) — bd:python-factory-2xbi Wave 1.
