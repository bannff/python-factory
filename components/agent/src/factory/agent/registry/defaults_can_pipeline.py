"""CAN bus failure prediction pipeline graph (Epic 6 — Agentic Dataset Skills).

5-stage data pipeline reflected as a 6-node agent graph:
``can-ingest → can-profiler → can-synthesizer → can-trainer``. The
five dataset stages — ``ingest → profile → synthesize → window →
augment`` — are orchestrated by the recipe materializer (see
``factory.dataset.runtime.materializer``); the ``window`` and
``augment`` graph nodes are documentation markers that share the
``can-synthesizer`` agent persona because all five dataset stages are
submitted as a single ``recipe://local/can-pipeline-aug@1`` job.
The ``train`` node is an ML step (``ml_train_timeseries``), not a
dataset stage, but is kept in the graph for end-to-end visibility.

Each ``agent``-type node references a registered ``AgentConfig``;
runtime ``system_prompt`` and ``skills`` resolve from the registry at
graph build time (AgentNodeRef.agent_id → defaults.AGENTS_TYPED
lookup). The graph itself is the registered ``can-pipeline``; agent
personas live in ``defaults_can_agents`` and skill content in
``skills/{can-analyst,can-recipe-author,can-evaluator}/SKILL.md``.

bd:python-factory-2tgo1 — the per-node ``skills`` field is left empty
because each node's system_prompt is owned by the referenced agent
(no inline override ⇒ no need to duplicate the skills list here).
