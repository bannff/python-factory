"""CAN failure-prediction taxonomy — relationship-type definitions.

bd:python-factory-relativix; context extension bd:python-factory-ctx1.
Companion to ``can_failure_nodes.py`` and
the top-level ``can_failure.py`` register entry point. Pure data;
relationship shapes mirror ``mcp/docs_taxonomy_ext.py::EXT_RELATIONSHIP_TYPES``
so the same code can walk any domain's relationship schema.

Source / target constraints are intentionally narrow (one node type
per endpoint) where the semantics demand it (HAS_ECU, EMITS_FRAME,
PART_OF_TRIP) and pipe-delimited where the spec allows flexibility
(CORRELATES_WITH, PRECEDES_FAILURE — both Signal endpoints, but the
target FailureMode may also be reachable from a Frame). Callers that
want strict validation can split on ``"|"`` and check membership.
