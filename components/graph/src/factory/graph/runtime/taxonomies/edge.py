"""Edge mesh workflow taxonomy — registration entry point.

Companion-X edge doctrine (Orchestrator v2 / Edge section): edge
artifacts are DATA — the vocabulary of the mesh-workflow design
(``projects/companion_x/experiments/edge_models/edge-mesh-workflow-design/``,
schema v1: workflows / claims / results / mesh_membership collections,
content-addressed ids, derived task state) as a first-class taxonomy.
This module is the **single import target** for cross-brick consumers —
it re-exports the node / relationship data and exposes ``register()`` +
``DOMAIN_ID``.

Usage::

    from factory.graph.runtime.taxonomies.edge import register
    register()  # one call at process start

    # Or via the public interface:
    from factory.graph.interface import register_edge_taxonomy
    register_edge_taxonomy()

Splitting rationale mirrors ``can_failure``: ``edge_nodes.py`` and
``edge_relationships.py`` keep the data files under 200 LOC; this file
owns the registration call + the conventions dict (the
``entity_id_conventions`` block is derived from the node-type dict to
avoid drift between the two).
