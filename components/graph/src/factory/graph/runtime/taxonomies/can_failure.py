"""CAN failure-prediction taxonomy — registration entry point.

bd:python-factory-relativix (epic python-factory-can-failure). Implements
the ``can_failure`` domain extension described in
``.github/spec/can-failure-prediction.md`` §2.1 and
``.github/spec/rando.md`` §10.4. This module is the **single import
target** for cross-brick consumers — it re-exports the node / relationship
data and exposes ``register()`` + ``DOMAIN_ID``.

Usage::

    from factory.graph.runtime.taxonomies.can_failure import register
    register()  # one call at process start; idempotent at the process level

    # Or via the public interface:
    from factory.graph.interface import register_can_failure_taxonomy
    register_can_failure_taxonomy()

Splitting rationale: ``can_failure_nodes.py`` and
``can_failure_relationships.py`` keep the data files under 200 LOC;
this file owns the registration call + the conventions dict (the
``entity_id_conventions`` block is derived from the node-type dict to
avoid drift between the two).
