"""CAN taxonomy wiring stage for the Relativix failure pipeline.

Sits between ``can_ingest`` (or any later stage) and downstream
consumers. Reads canonical ``can_frame`` records, walks each one to
discover unique ``Vehicle`` / ``Trip`` / ``CANBus`` / ``ECU`` / ``Signal``
entities, materializes a ``Frame`` entity per record, and writes the
core taxonomy relationships into the graph brick's memory adapter
(persistent NetworkX by default).

The stage is **opt-in**: when ``enable_taxonomy`` is False the adapter
is a no-op pass-through that only adds an empty ``taxonomy_node_ids``
field to each record. That lets recipes opt into the wiring without
breaking existing pipelines.

Why batch writes?
    The graph brick's ``PersistentNetworkXGraph`` snapshots after every
    mutation, so issuing one ``add_entity`` per record would O(N) the
    disk. We collect unique entities in a single pass, then issue one
    mutation per *unique* node / relationship.
