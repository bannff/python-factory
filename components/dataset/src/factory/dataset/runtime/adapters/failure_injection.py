"""Failure-mode injection for synthetic CAN data (Phases 3, 4, 5).

Supports four injection strategies:

* ``"rule"``        — the original eight Relativix fault modes
  (``signal_drift``, ``drop_to_zero``, ``out_of_sequence``,
  ``sensor_degradation``, ``ecu_timeout``, ``signal_freeze``,
  ``spike_noise``, ``correlation_break``).
* ``"learned"``     — every failure is sampled from a
  :data:`LearnedSampler` (typically a conditional TimeGAN trained on
  SCANIA APS patterns) and blended into the pre-failure context.
* ``"hybrid"``      — 30% rule / 70% learned, picked per event.
* ``"correlation"`` — uses a precomputed signal correlation matrix
  (typically emitted by ``can_profile``) to corrupt MULTIPLE
  correlated signals together with a gradual onset/sustained/decay
  envelope. Physically realistic: a single bus fault (EMI, connector
  corrosion) couples signals together, so a noisy root line
  propagates into its coupled neighbors.

Blending for the learned path is handled in
:mod:`_hybrid_injection_helpers`; the rule-mode primitives live in
:mod:`_rule_failure_helpers`; the correlation matrix math lives in
:mod:`_correlation_matrix_helpers` and the correlation orchestrator
in :mod:`_correlation_injection_helpers`. This file dispatches them
all and stays under the 200-LOC factory ceiling.

In-place mutation keeps the synthetic stream ordered so downstream
sequence-aware models see the same windowed anomalies they would on
a real bus.

    ``"correlation"`` requires a ``correlation_matrix`` (typically
