"""Correlation-based failure injection orchestrator (Phase 5).

The fourth injection strategy for the Relativix CAN failure pipeline.
Mutates ``records[start:end]`` so a cluster of correlated signals
(maybe 2-4, picked from the precomputed matrix) is corrupted
together with a gradual onset/sustained/decay envelope.

This is physically realistic: real CAN bus faults (EMI bursts,
connector corrosion, ECU power dips) couple signals together, so
a single root cause produces observable symptoms on multiple lines.
A noise burst on the engine RPM line, for instance, also perturbs
the correlated vehicle-speed signal.

Why a separate file: the data-shaping primitives
(:func:`normalize_correlation_matrix`, :func:`build_envelope`,
:func:`pick_root_cluster`) live in :mod:`_correlation_matrix_helpers`
so this orchestrator stays under the 200-LOC factory ceiling.

    Algorithm:

    1. Discover signal names from the first record that exposes them.
    2. Normalize the matrix (any supported shape) to a pair dict.
    3. Pick a root + correlated cluster, weighted by coupling degree.
    4. Build a 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 envelope.
    5. For each frame, draw a single Gaussian shock; apply it to the
       root at full magnitude and to each neighbor scaled by
       ``|corr(root, neighbor)|`` with the correlation's sign so
       positively-coupled signals move together (and anti-coupled
       signals move in the opposite direction). Magnitude is
       ``envelope * noise_multiplier * local_signal_std`` so the
