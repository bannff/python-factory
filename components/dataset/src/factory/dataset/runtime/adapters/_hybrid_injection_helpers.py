"""Hybrid (rule + learned) failure injection helpers.

Extracted from :mod:`failure_injection` to keep that orchestrator under
the 200-LOC factory ceiling. The hybrid strategy blends the existing
eight rule-based Relativix modes with a learned failure generator
(typically a conditional TimeGAN trained on SCANIA APS patterns).

Three sub-strategies are supported:

* ``"rule"``    — 100% rule-based (the legacy behavior).
* ``"learned"`` — 100% learned via the ``LearnedSampler`` callable.
* ``"hybrid"``  — 30% rule / 70% learned, picked per event.

Blending math: the learned window is a z-score-normalized
``(T, F)`` trajectory. We anchor the trajectory's first frame to the
records' pre-failure baseline (the actual decoded signal values) and
linearly interpolate to the learned failure endpoint, so the transition
into the failure is smooth and physically plausible.
