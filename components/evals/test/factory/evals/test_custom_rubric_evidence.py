"""Regression: custom rubrics must reach the judge even without placeholders.

A bare rubric ("score 1.0 if X") previously judged blind because openevals
only injects params the prompt references — both good and bad outputs scored
0.0. The providers now inject an evidence block when the rubric omits it.
