# CAN Failure Prediction — Handover Document

**Date:** 2026-07-28
**Status:** In Progress — Physical failure modes wired, pipeline needs re-run
**Session:** opencode → next agent

---

## 1. Current State

We've built an agentic CAN failure prediction system with context-aware failure injection. The system runs through MCP tools via Companion-X server (port 8000).

### What's Working

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Physical failure modes | ✅ Wired | 8 modes in `_physical_failure_modes.py`, now default dispatch |
| MCP pipeline | ✅ Working | `dataset_submit_generation` → `dataset_get_job` → `dataset_get_artifact` |
| Context-aware injection | ✅ Implemented | adapters for weather, GPS, vehicle metadata |
| Taxonomy extensions | ✅ Complete | 6 new nodes, 5 new relationships |
| Quality checks | ✅ Complete | CAN-specific validation in `quality_can.py` |
| Recipe config | ✅ Updated | Explicit failure_rate=0.1, all 8 modes |

### What Needs Fixing

1. **Failure rate bug** — Pipeline produces ~89% failures instead of configured 10%. The `_AVG_WINDOW=35` heuristic may be miscalculated.
2. **AUROC 0.50** — Models can't learn because of class imbalance (consequence of bug #1).
3. **Re-run needed** — After fixing bug #1, re-run pipeline and retrain models.

## 6. Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Failure Rate Bug

The pipeline produces ~89% failures instead of 10%. Investigate:

1. Check `_AVG_WINDOW=35` calculation in `failure_injection.py`
2. Verify recipe config propagates correctly through `_parse_config_params`
3. Add debug logging to `inject_failures` to trace the rate calculation
4. Fix and re-run pipeline

### Priority 2: Verify Physical Modes Active

Confirm that `PHYSICAL_RULE_DISPATCH` is being used:
```python
# In failure_injection.py, check line 190
handler = PHYSICAL_RULE_DISPATCH.get(mode)  # Should be this
# NOT
handler = _RULE_DISPATCH.get(mode)  # Legacy
```

### Priority 3: Re-run Pipeline

After fixing bug #1:
```bash
# Submit with correct config
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"call_brick_tool","arguments":{"brick_name":"dataset","tool_name":"dataset_submit_generation","arguments":"<correct_config>"}},"id":1}'
```

### Priority 4: Train Models

After re-run:
```bash
# Train LightGBM
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"call_brick_tool","arguments":{"brick_name":"machine_learning","tool_name":"ml_train_timeseries","arguments":"{\"model_type\":\"lightgbm\",\"X_uri\":\"file:///tmp/25_X_flat.npy\",\"y_uri\":\"file:///tmp/25_y.npy\"}"}},"id":1}'
```

### Priority 5: Get SME Evaluation

After models are trained, consult meta-architect for evaluation.

## 7. Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Extend dataset brick | Natural extension point for CAN pipeline |
| Context is opt-in | `use_context=False` default preserves backward compat |
| Physical modes are default | `_DEFAULT_MODES = _ALL_MODES` |
| MCP-first | All operations through `call_brick_tool` |
| Models consume context as features | CAN signals + context fields in feature matrix |

---

## 8. Vision

The system should:
1. Inject failures based on **real-world conditions** (weather, driving style, vehicle age)
2. Train models with **CAN signals + context features**
3. Predict failures with **awareness of real-world conditions**
4. Provide **explainable predictions** ("battery failure because temp=-5°C, mileage=142k km")

- **Meta-architect**: For design reviews and architectural decisions
- **Strands-expert**: For MCP tool patterns and agent orchestration
- **QA tester**: For test verification and quality checks
