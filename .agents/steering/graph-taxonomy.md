# Unified Graph Taxonomy

> Single source of truth for all node labels, relationship types, and property schemas in the Neo4j knowledge graph.

## Overview

All brick data converges in one Neo4j instance. Companion-X renders it in the Graph view. Two persistence patterns exist:

- **Direct driver** — graph, memory, storage bricks own a `neo4j.GraphDatabase` connection and run Cypher directly.
- **MCP aggregator** — evals, metrics, security, ML bricks call `graph_graph_add_entity` / `graph_graph_add_relationship` through the MCP gateway. Preferred for new adapters.

## Node Labels

### Memory brick (direct driver)

| Label | Props | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `Memory` | id, user_id, content, memory_type (`short_term`/`long_term`), category, created_at, updated_at, keywords[], context, tags[], evolution_status, embedding[], relevance_score, expires_at, meta_* | A-MEM evolution adds keywords/tags/context |
| `User` | id | Anchor node for `HAS_MEMORY` ownership |

### Graph brick (direct driver)

| Label | Props | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `__Entity__` | id, type, properties{} | Generic entity (152 existing). Label is the `entity_type` param; `__Entity__` is the base label |
| `Document` | id, content, metadata | Ingested document (576 existing) |

### KB brick

| Label | Props | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `KBDocument` | id, content, embedding[] | Vector-indexed knowledge base doc (10 existing) |

### Evals brick (MCP aggregator)

| `Snapshot` | metric_id, year, month, created_at | Aggregated metric state |
| `Baseline` | metric_id, tag, values(json), created_at | Named baseline for regression gating |

### Security brick (MCP aggregator)

| Label | Props | Notes |

| `SecurityAction` | action_type, status, created_at, target, summary | Analysis run (threat_model, code_scan, etc.) |
| `Finding` | id, title, description, severity, location, remediation, cwe, evidence, created_at | Security finding (3 existing) |

### Taint Analysis (security brick — planned)

| Label | Props | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `TaintSource` | id, param, endpoint, file, source_type, created_at | User-controlled entry point (e.g. HTTP param). Created by `security.trace_taint` results persisted to graph |
| `TaintSink` | id, sink_type, function, file, line, created_at | Dangerous operation (e.g. `cursor.execute`, `innerHTML`). Sink patterns come from `vuln_class_config.taint_sinks` |
| `TaintHop` | id, file, function, line, hop_type (controller/service/dao/middleware/unknown), auth_check_present, auth_check_type, code, created_at | Intermediate step in a taint flow. Each hop records whether an auth check was found nearby |

| `GameMove` | step, action, command, path, flag, ts, + any extra move dict fields | Individual move within a game. Properties spread from the move dict |

### Telemetry materialization projection (Telemetry brick via MCP)

`run_id` is the durable execution join; `workflow_run_id` is accepted only as a legacy ingress alias and normalized at the boundary. `trace_id`/`span_id` preserve W3C topology and never substitute for `run_id`; session, agent, workflow, graph, and swarm identifiers retain their separate meanings. Telemetry owns authenticated OTLP ingress, normalized/raw evidence, and allowlisted bounded materialization through typed MCP tools. The legacy gateway `graph_sink` is compatibility-only.

A materialized relationship derives its ID from source system, stable source identity/digest, relationship type, and endpoints. Equal replays create-or-match; mismatches are explicit conflicts; rebuild/reconciliation converges from durable references. Graph retains reference/digest and browse metadata—not raw telemetry—and a NetworkX adapter is durable only with explicit persistent restore and reconciliation.

| Label | Props | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `WorkflowRun` | run_id, status (`running`/`completed`/`failed`), started_at, principal_id (optional), created_at | Root anchor for a workflow execution. ID `workflow-run-{run_id}`. Workflow owns status; Telemetry only projects a bounded reference. |

| `Session` | id, session_type, principal_id, agent_id, status, started_at, ended_at, metadata(json), created_at | Groups related interaction activity; it does not replace `run_id`. |
| `Swarm` | swarm_id (config id), run_id, entry_point, agent_count, status (`running`/`completed`), started_at, completed_at, execution_time, created_at | Orchestrator node, one per swarm execution. Materialised by `components/events/runtime/lineage_handlers/swarm_lineage.py` on `swarm.launched` / `swarm.completed` events. ID `swarm-{swarm_id}-{run_id}` |
| `Graph` | graph_id (config id), run_id, node_count, entry_points (comma-joined), status (`running`/`completed`/`failed`), started_at, completed_at, failed_at, execution_time, execution_order (comma-joined), error (if failed), created_at | Orchestrator node, one per graph workflow execution. Materialised by `lineage_handlers/graph_lineage.py` on `graph.launched` / `graph.completed` / `graph.failed` events. ID `graph-{graph_id}-{run_id}` |
| `Agent` | agent_id, created_at | See "Other existing" below — also materialised by `lineage_handlers/swarm_lineage.py` on `swarm.node_start` events. ID `agent-{agent_id}` |

### Taint Analysis (security brick — planned)

| Type | Direction | Props | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|-------|
| `FLOWS_TO` | TaintHop → TaintHop | ordinal (int) | Ordered taint propagation between hops |
| `FLOWS_TO` | TaintSource → TaintHop | ordinal (int) | Source to first hop |

Longitudinal GT scoring history now lives in the sqlite `eval_results` collection (one doc per run, doc_id `eval-{run_id}`), written by the `evals_persist_score` MCP tool and queryable via `storage_doc_query`. The schema row is preserved for historical reads — older Neo4j databases may still contain these edges from runs prior to the cutover. New code MUST NOT write `EVALUATED_AGAINST`. The `graph` brick's IDOR taxonomy doc (`docs_taxonomy_idor.py`) still lists this type as reference data only. |

## Workflow-id Naming Convention (open vs targeted)

Registry ids encode whether a registration is `kind=workflow` or
`kind=graph`, and (for security workflows) whether the variant is
class-targeted or class-open:

- **`kind=workflow`** registrations drop the `rt-` prefix when newly
  authored: `recon-app`, `sandbox-setup`, `sast`, `dast`. The
  in-place SAST canary kept its original id `rt-sast-scan` for
  consumer back-compat (bd-a4h7).
- **`kind=graph`** registrations keep the `rt-` prefix:
  `rt-recon-graph`, `rt-recon-hybrid`, `rt-sast-scan-hybrid`,
  `rt-scan-idor`, `rt-scan-idor-hybrid`.
- **Targeted variants** keep `vuln_class` in `context_vars` for
  GT-eval comparison runs (one class per invocation).
- **Open variants** drop `vuln_class` and let the agent chain
  attacks across all 9 classes (IDOR / SQLi / XSS / SSRF / CSRF /
  Path-Traversal / Cmd-Injection / Deserialization / Mass-Assignment).
- **Hybrids stay `kind=graph`** because Strands `WorkflowManager`
  cannot embed a Swarm — they're azca experiment arms with
  model-diversity ensembles, dispatched via `GraphExecutor` +
  `SwarmNode`. See `.agents/recipes/workflow-migration.md`.

## Property Conventions

- **`created_at`** — required on all nodes. ISO 8601 UTC string.
- **Complex values** — JSON-serialized strings (Neo4j doesn't support nested maps). Props: `config`, `labels`, `params`, `metrics`, `tags`.
- **Timestamps** — ISO 8601 for dates (`created_at`, `run_at`). Unix epoch float for time-series (`DataPoint.timestamp`).
- **Arrays** — `keywords[]`, `tags[]`, `embedding[]` stored as Neo4j native lists.
- **Cross-domain edge props** — `score` (float), `reason` (string), `created_at` (ISO 8601).

## MCP Aggregator Pattern

New adapters should use the MCP aggregator instead of direct Neo4j drivers. The evals `graph_adapter.py` is the canonical exemplar.

```python
# Lazy-load the aggregator (avoids import-time coupling)
def _get_aggregator() -> Any:
    from factory.mcp_server.interface import get_server, get_aggregator
    get_server()
    return get_aggregator()

def _invoke(tool_name: str, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
    agg = _get_aggregator()
    if agg is None:
        raise RuntimeError("MCP aggregator not available")
    return agg.invoke_tool(tool_name, **kwargs)

# Create a node
_invoke("graph_graph_add_entity",
    entity_id="eval-run-42",
    entity_type="EvalRun",
    properties={"suite_id": "s1", "pass_rate": 0.95, "created_at": _utcnow()})

# Create a relationship
_invoke("graph_graph_add_relationship",
    relationship_id="evaluated-by-42",
    relationship_type="EVALUATED_BY",
    source_id="eval-suite-s1",
    target_id="eval-run-42")

# Find entities using the portable typed API
_invoke("graph_graph_find_entities", entity_type="EvalRun",
        properties={"suite_id": "s1"}, limit=100)
```

## Naming Rules

| Element | Convention | Examples |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Node labels | PascalCase | `FineTuningJob`, `EvalRun`, `KBDocument` |
| Relationship types | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE | `RECORDED_FOR`, `EVALUATED_BY`, `CHECKPOINT_OF` |
| Entity IDs | kebab-case with brick prefix | `eval-run-`, `ft-job-`, `ml-exp-`, `cwe-` |
| Properties | snake_case | `created_at`, `pass_rate`, `base_model` |

## Known caveat: edge collision on nx.DiGraph backend

On the in-memory `nx.DiGraph` backend, edges dedupe by `(source, target)`. Within a single session, `NEXT_IN_RUN` and `FOLLOWED_BY` share endpoints — `FOLLOWED_BY` wins because it is written second and overwrites the earlier `NEXT_IN_RUN` entry. For visualizations and run-topology queries, treat the `sequence` property on `ToolInvocation` as canonical instead of querying raw `NEXT_IN_RUN` edges; that is what `graph_get_run_topology` does. A future Neo4j backend (which keys edges by type as well as endpoints) would have no collision.
