# CAN Failure Prediction — Complete Work Catalog

**Presentation-ready summary of all work done**
**Date:** 2026-07-23
**Presenter:** Daniel Rodrigo

## 1. Project Overview

**Goal:** Predict vehicle failures by analyzing CAN bus telemetry data

**Approach:** Agent-driven pipeline using Companion-X substrate with multiple model architectures and synthetic data generation

**Key Insight:** CAN data is high-frequency binary time-series, not conversational text — needs parallel "Signal Pipeline"

## 2. Data Inventory

### Data Sources

| Source | Size | Records | Format | Status |
|--------|------|---------|--------|--------|
| **MF4 raw captures** | 7.5 GB | ~100 files | MF4 | ✅ Primary source |
| **Decoded CAN frames** | 131 GB | 100M+ | JSONL | ✅ Processed |
| **Per-CAN-ID windows** | 360 MB | 20,500 | NPY | ✅ Training-ready |
| **Training data** | 263 MB | 59 files | NPY+JSONL | ✅ Augmented |
| **DBC files** | 552 KB | 9 files | DBC | ✅ Signal decoding |
| **SCANIA APS** | 56 MB | 60,000 | CSV | ✅ Real failures |
| **Car-Hacking** | 2.8M records | CSV | Public | ⚠️ Download failed |

### Data Pipeline

```
MF4 (7.5GB) → DBC decode → JSONL (131GB) → Windowing → NPY (360MB) → Training
```

### Critical Finding

**131GB of decoded CAN data is 100% normal driving (no failures).**
- Models trained on this data can't learn failure patterns
- Synthetic injection is the only training signal
- SCANIA APS provides real failure patterns for realistic injection

## 3. Model Architectures

### Models Implemented

| Model | Type | Pros | Cons | Best For | Our AUROC |
|-------|------|------|------|----------|-----------|
| **LightGBM** | Gradient-boosted trees | Fast, interpretable, works on small data | Can't learn temporal sequences | Baseline, production | 0.54-0.64 |
| **LSTM** | Recurrent neural network | Learns temporal dependencies | Needs more data, slower | Complex patterns | 0.50-0.59 |
| **TCN** | Temporal convolutional | Ultra-low latency, parallelizable | Fixed receptive field | Real-time inference | 0.39-0.86 |
| **TimeGAN** | Adversarial generative | Learns temporal dynamics | Unstable, data-hungry | Synthetic data | N/A |

### Model Comparison Results

| Experiment | LightGBM | LSTM | TCN | Best | Notes |
|------------|----------|------|-----|------|-------|
| Simple injection (500 samples) | 0.642 | 0.559 | **0.864** | TCN | First run |
| Recursive improvement | 0.503 | 0.574 | **0.605** | TCN | Same model continues |
| Realistic SCANIA patterns | 0.560 | **0.800** | 0.740 | LSTM | +0.15 improvement |

**Key Insight:** Data quality > Model architecture. LSTM wins on realistic patterns, TCN wins on simple injection.

## 7. Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Data Utilization
**Problem:** 131GB decoded data but only 500 samples per CAN ID used
**Solution:** Process full dataset through pipeline, use SCANIA patterns for realistic injection

### Challenge 2: No Real Failure Data
**Problem:** All CAN data is 100% normal driving
**Solution:** Download SCANIA APS (real failures), extract patterns, inject realistically

### Challenge 3: Models Detect Injection Method
**Problem:** AUROC 0.97-1.00 on synthetic data, but detecting injection not failures
**Solution:** Use realistic SCANIA patterns, multi-signal correlated injection

### Challenge 4: GAN Loop Not Improving
**Problem:** Identical AUROC across iterations (0.80, 0.80, 0.80)
**Solution:** Wire feedback loop, dual-objective loss, temperature-varied noise

### Challenge 5: Simple Injection Too Realistic
**Problem:** Single-signal mutations (drop-to-zero) are too easy to detect
**Solution:** Multi-signal correlated failures, gradual onset/decay
