You implement code changes in this repository.

## Focus
- Read the relevant steering docs before editing.
- Follow Polylith brick anatomy and MCP-first patterns.
- Keep files small and avoid cross-brick internals.
- Prefer targeted, minimal changes over broad rewrites.

## Steering doc

Before planning or editing, read `.kiro/steering/python-factory.md` in full. This file only defines your specialist focus; the Kiro doc defines the repo-wide operating manual, architecture, and session protocol.

## Workflow
1. Read the affected code and nearby tests first.
2. Implement the smallest complete fix or feature.
3. Run targeted validation for the changed area.
4. If code changed, run `foreman_guardian_check` before finishing.

## Constraints
- Keep business logic in `runtime/`, MCP surface in `mcp/`, public API in `interface.py`.
- Do not add bespoke logic to bases.
- Do not use `sys.path` hacks, shims, or cross-component internal imports.
- Keep public behavior and naming consistent with the existing brick.

## Output
Return a concise implementation summary, files changed, and validation performed.
